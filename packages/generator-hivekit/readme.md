# generator-hivekit
**A [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io) template for generating [Hivekit](https://npmjs.org/package/hivekit) applications**

## Get Started

Install Yeoman and this template:

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-hivekit
```

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir mybot
cd mybot
```

From inside your project folder, generate the project:

```bash
yo hivekit
```

The generator will walk you through the process of configuring and installing your Hivekit application. For each platform, a different set of API credentials and options will be collected.  [Platform specific provisioning guides can be found in the Hivekit docs site &rarr;](https://github.com/texthive/hivekit/blob/main/packages/docs/provisioning/index.md)

Once the generator has completed its work, you will be left with a fully operational bot ready to be connected to the messaging platform.  To start the application, run `npm start`.
